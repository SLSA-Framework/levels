title: Provenance
layout: standard
hero_text: To trace software back to the source and define the moving parts in a complex supply chain, provenance needs to be there from the very beginning. It’s the verifiable information about software artifacts describing where, when and how something was produced. For higher SLSA levels and more resilient integrity guarantees, provenance requirements are stricter and need a deeper, more technical understanding of the predicate.
---
<!-- Note: We only include the major version in the URL, e.g. "v1" instead of
"v1.0", because minor versions are guaranteed to be backwards compatible. We
still include the minor version number in the selector (_data/versions.yml) so
that readers can easily find the current minor version number. -->

## Purpose

Describe how an artifact or set of artifacts was produced so that:

-   Consumers of the provenance can verify that the artifact was built according
    to expectations.
-   Others can rebuild the artifact, if desired.

This predicate is the recommended way to satisfy the SLSA [provenance
requirements](/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-generation).

## Prerequisite

Understanding of SLSA [Software Attestations](/attestation-model)
and the larger [in-toto attestation] framework.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Model

Provenance is an attestation that the `builder` produced the `subject` software
artifacts through execution of the `buildDefinition`.

![Build Model](model.svg)

The model is as follows:

-   Each build runs as an independent process on a multi-tenant platform. The
    `builder` is the identity of this platform, representing the transitive
    closure of all entities that are [trusted] to faithfully run the build and
    record the provenance. (Note: The same model can be used for platform-less
    or single-tenant build systems.)

-   The build process is defined by a parameterized template, identified by
    `buildType`. Often a build platform only supports a single build type. For
    example, the GitHub Actions platform only supports executing a GitHub
    Actions workflow file.

-   All top-level, independent inputs are captured by the parameters to the
    template. There are two types of parameters:

    -   `externalParameters`: the external interface to the build. In SLSA,
        these values are untrusted; they MUST be included in the provenance and
        MUST be verified downstream.

    -   `systemParameters`: set internally by the platform. In SLSA, these
        values are trusted because the platform is trusted; they are OPTIONAL
        and need not be verified downstream. They MAY be included to enable
        reproducible builds, debugging, or incident response.

    Some (but not all) parameters are references to artifacts. For example, the
    external parameters for a GitHub Actions workflow includes the source
    repository (artifact reference) and the path to the workflow file (string
    value).

-   All other artifacts fetched during initialization or execution of the build
    process are considered dependencies. The `resolvedDependencies` captures
    these dependencies, if known.

-   During execution, the build process MAY communicate with the build
    platform's control plane and/or build caches. This communication is not
    captured in the provenance but is subject to [SLSA
    Requirements](/spec/v1.0/requirements).

-   Finally, the build process outputs one or more artifacts, identified by
    `subject`.

For concrete examples, see [index of build types](#index-of-build-types).

> **TODO:** Align with the [Build model](/spec/v1.0/terminology#build-model).

## Parsing rules

This predicate follows the in-toto attestation [parsing rules]. Summary:

-   Consumers MUST ignore unrecognized fields.
-   The `predicateType` URI includes the major version number and will always
    change whenever there is a backwards incompatible change.
-   Minor version changes are always backwards compatible and "monotonic." Such
    changes do not update the `predicateType`.
-   Producers MAY add extension fields using field names that are URIs.
-   Optional fields MAY be unset or null, and should be treated equivalently.
    Both are equivalent to empty for _object_ or _array_ values.

## Schema

_NOTE: This section describes the fields within `predicate`. For a description
of the other top-level fields, such as `subject`, see [Statement]._

<!-- Note: While this happens to be a valid cue file, we're really just using it
as a human-readable summary of the schema. We don't want readers to have to
understand cue. For that reason, we are not using any special cue syntax or
features. -->

### Provenance

[Provenance]: #provenance

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `buildDefinition`, `runDetails`

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="buildDefinition"><td><code>buildDefinition</code>
<td><a href="#builddefinition">BuildDefinition</a><td>

The input to the build. The accuracy and completeness are implied by `runDetails.builder.id`.

<tr id="runDetails"><td><code>runDetails</code>
<td><a href="#rundetails">RunDetails</a><td>

Details specific to this particular execution of the build.

</table>

### BuildDefinition

[BuildDefinition]: #builddefinition

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `buildType`, `externalParameters`

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="buildType"><td><code>buildType</code>
<td>string (<a href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/field_types.md#TypeURI">TypeURI</a>)<td>

Identifies the template for how to perform the build and interpret the
parameters and dependencies.

The URI SHOULD resolve to a human-readable specification that includes: overall
description of the build type; a list of all parameters (name, description,
external vs system, artifact vs scalar vs..., required vs optional, etc.);
unambiguous instructions for how to initiate the build given this
BuildDefinition, and a complete example. Example:
https://slsa.dev/github-actions-workflow/v0.1

<tr id="externalParameters"><td><code>externalParameters</code>
<td>map (string→<a href="#parametervalue">ParameterValue</a>)<td>

The parameters that are under external control, such as those set by a user or
tenant of the build system. They MUST be complete at SLSA Build L3, meaning that
that there is no additional mechanism for an external party to influence the
build. (At lower SLSA Build levels, the completeness MAY be best effort.)

The build system SHOULD be designed to minimize the size and complexity of
`externalParameters`, in order to reduce fragility and ease [verification].
Consumers SHOULD have an expectation of what "good" looks like; the more
information that they need to check, the harder that task becomes.

<tr id="systemParameters"><td><code>systemParameters</code>
<td>map (string→<a href="#parametervalue">ParameterValue</a>)<td>

The parameters that are under the control of the `builder`. The primary
intention of this field is for debugging, incident response, and vulnerability
management. The values here MAY be necessary for reproducing the build. There is
no need to [verify][Verification] these parameters because the build system is
already trusted, and in many cases it is not practical to do so.

<tr id="resolvedDependencies"><td><code>resolvedDependencies</code>
<td>array (<a href="#artifactreference">ArtifactReference</a>)<td>

Collection of artifacts needed at build time, aside from those listed in
`externalParameters` or `systemParameters`. For example, if the build script
fetches and executes "example.com/foo.sh", which in turn fetches
"example.com/bar.tar.gz", then both "foo.sh" and "bar.tar.gz" should be listed
here.

</table>

The BuildDefinition describes all of the inputs to the build. It SHOULD contain
all the information necessary and sufficient to initialize the build and begin
execution.

The `externalParameters` and `systemParameters` are the top-level inputs to the
template, meaning inputs not derived from another input. Each field is a map
from parameter name to [parameter value][ParameterValue]. The each parameter
name MUST be unique across `externalParameters` and `systemParameters`. The
following conventional names are RECOMMENDED when appropriate:

-   `source`: The primary input to the build.
-   `config`: The build configuration, if different from `source`.

Guidelines:

-   Maximize the amount of information that is implicit from the meaning of
    `buildType`. In particular, any value that is boilerplate and the same
    for every build SHOULD be implicit.

-   Reduce parameters by moving configuration to input artifacts whenever
    possible. For example, instead of passing in compiler flags via an external
    parameter that has to be [verified][Verification] separately, require the
    flags to live next to the source code or build configuration so that
    verifying the latter automatically verifies the compiler flags.

-   If possible, architect the build system to use this definition as its
    sole top-level input, in order to guarantee that the information is
    sufficient to run the build.

-   In some cases, the build configuration is evaluated client-side and
    sent over the wire, such that the build system cannot determine its
    origin. In those cases, the build system SHOULD serialize the
    configuration in a deterministic way and record the `digest` without a
    `uri`. This allows one to consider the client-side evaluation as a
    separate "build" with its own provenance, such that the verifier can
    chain the two provenance attestations together to determine the origin
    of the configuration.

**TODO:** Explain the purpose of `resolvedDependencies`. Why do we need it? What
goes in it? Is it OK for it to be incomplete? If a dependency is already pinned,
does it need to be listed? How does one choose between `resolvedDependencies`
and `builderDependencies`?

### ParameterValue

[ParameterValue]: #parametervalue

REQUIRED: exactly one of the fields MUST be set.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `artifactRef` | [ArtifactReference] | Reference to an artifact. |
| `scalarValue` | string | Scalar value. |
| `mapValue` | map (string→string) | Unordered collection of name/value pairs. |
| `arrayValue` | array (string) | Ordered collection of values. |

For simplicity, only string values or collections of string values are
supported.

> ⚠ **RFC:** The design of parameters is still not settled. We welcome feedback
> on this particular design and suggestions for alternatives. In particular:
>
> -   How restrictive should we be? This is somewhat of a balance between making
>     it easier for the builder vs [verifier][Verification]. A very restrictive
>     type, such as only strings, makes it easier to set expectations but harder
>     for a builder to describe reality. A very open type, such as an arbitrary
>     JSON object, provides a lot of freedom to builders but possibly at the
>     cost of complexity in terms of expectations.
> -   Is there a better way to express types than using field names?
> -   Do we need [ArtifactReference]? Would it instead make sense to just have

>     `resolvedDependencies`? What is the specific use case?
>
> Alternatives considered so far:
>
> -   Only allow strings (difficult for many builders)
> -   Allow strings, maps of strings, or arrays of strings (current design)
> -   Allow arbitrary JSON (challenge: how do we do [ArtifactReference]?)

### ArtifactReference

[ArtifactReference]: #artifactreference

REQUIRED: at least one of `uri` or `digest`

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="uri"><td><code>uri</code>
<td>string (URI)<td>

URI describing where this artifact came from. When possible, this SHOULD
be a universal and stable identifier, such as a source location or Package
URL ([purl]).

<tr id="digest"><td><code>digest</code>
<td><a href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/field_types.md#DigestSet">DigestSet</a><td>

One or more cryptographic digests of the contents of this artifact.

**TODO:** Decide on hex vs base64 in #533 then document it here.

<tr id="localName"><td><code>localName</code>
<td>string<td>

The name for this artifact local to the build.

<tr id="downloadLocation"><td><code>downloadLocation</code>
<td>string (URI)<td>

URI identifying the location that this artifact was downloaded from, if
different and not derivable from `uri`.

</table>

Example:

```json
{
    "uri": "pkg:pypi/pyyaml@6.0",
    "digest": {"sha256": "5f0689d54944564971f2811f9788218bfafb21aa20f532e6490004377dfa648f"},

    "mediaType": "application/gzip"
}
```

> ⚠ **RFC:** Do we need all these fields? Is this adding too much complexity?

### RunDetails

[RunDetails]: #rundetails

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `builder` (unless `id` is implicit from the
attestation envelope)

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="builder"><td><code>builder</code>
<td><a href="#builder">Builder</a><td>

Identifies the entity that executed the invocation, which is trusted to have
correctly performed the operation and populated this provenance.

<tr id="metadata"><td><code>metadata</code>
<td><a href="#buildmetadata">BuildMetadata</a><td>

Metadata about this particular execution of the build.

<tr id="byproducts"><td><code>byproducts</code>
<td>array (<a href="#artifactreference">ArtifactReference</a>)<td>

Additional artifacts generated during the build that should not be considered
the "output" of the build but that may be needed during debugging or incident
response. For example, this might reference logs generated during the build
and/or a digest of the fully evaluated build configuration.

In most cases, this SHOULD NOT contain all intermediate files generated during
the build. Instead, this should only contain files that are likely to be useful
later and that cannot be easily reproduced.

**TODO:** Do we need some recommendation for how to distinguish between
byproducts? For example, should we recommend using `localName`?

</table>

### Builder

[Builder]: #builder

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `id` (unless implicit from the attestation envelope)

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="builder.id"><td><code>id</code>
<td>string (<a href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/field_types.md#TypeURI">TypeURI</a>)<td>

URI indicating the transitive closure of the trusted builder.

**TODO:** In most cases this is implicit from the envelope layer (e.g. the
public key or x.509 certificate), which is just one more thing to mess up. Can
we rescope this to avoid the duplication and thus the security concern? For
example, if the envelope identifies the build system, this might identify the
tenant project?

**TODO:** Provide guidance on how to choose a URI, what scope it should have,
stability, how [verification] works, etc.

<tr id="builder.version"><td><code>version</code>
<td>map (string→string)<td>

Version numbers of components of the builder.

<tr id="builderDependencies"><td><code>builderDependencies</code>
<td>array (<a href="#artifactreference">ArtifactReference</a>)<td>

Dependencies used by the orchestrator that are not run within the workload and
that should not affect the build, but may affect the provenance generation or
security guarantees.

**TODO:** Flesh out this model more.

</table>

The builder represents the transitive closure of all the entities that are, by
necessity, [trusted] to faithfully run the build and record the provenance.

The `id` MUST reflect the trust base that consumers care about. How detailed to
be is a judgement call. For example, GitHub Actions supports both GitHub-hosted
runners and self-hosted runners. The GitHub-hosted runner might be a single
identity because it's all GitHub from the consumer's perspective. Meanwhile,
each self-hosted runner might have its own identity because not all runners are
trusted by all consumers.

Consumers MUST accept only specific signer-builder pairs. For example, "GitHub"
can sign provenance for the "GitHub Actions" builder, and "Google" can sign
provenance for the "Google Cloud Build" builder, but "GitHub" cannot sign for
the "Google Cloud Build" builder.

Design rationale: The builder is distinct from the signer because one signer
may generate attestations for more than one builder, as in the GitHub Actions
example above. The field is required, even if it is implicit from the signer,
to aid readability and debugging. It is an object to allow additional fields
in the future, in case one URI is not sufficient.

> ⚠ **RFC:** Should we just allow builders to set arbitrary properties, rather
> than calling out `version` and `builderDependencies`? We don't expect
> verifiers to use any of them, so maybe that's the simpler approach? Or have a
> `properties` that is an arbitrary object? (#319)

> ⚠ **RFC:** Do we want/need to identify the tenant of the build system,

> fields (e.g. `{"id": "https://builder.example", "tenant":
> "https://company1.example/project1"}`)? What would the use case be for this?
> How should [verification] work?

### BuildMetadata

[BuildMetadata]: #buildmetadata

REQUIRED: (none)

<table>
<tr><th>Field<th>Type<th>Description

<tr id="invocationId"><td><code>invocationId</code>
<td>string<td>

Identifies this particular build invocation, which can be useful for finding
associated logs or other ad-hoc analysis. The exact meaning and format is
defined by `builder.id`; by default it is treated as opaque and case-sensitive.
The value SHOULD be globally unique.

<tr id="startedOn"><td><code>startedOn</code>
<td>string (<a href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/field_types.md#Timestamp">Timestamp</a>)<td>

The timestamp of when the build started.

<tr id="finishedOn"><td><code>finishedOn</code>
<td>string (<a href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/field_types.md#Timestamp">Timestamp</a>)<td>

The timestamp of when the build completed.

</table>

## Verification

[Verification]: #verification

> **TODO:** Describe how clients are expected to verify the provenance.

## Index of build types

The following is an partial index of build type definitions. Each contains a
complete example predicate.

-   [GitHub Actions Workflow](../../github-actions-workflow/v0.1/)

**TODO:** Before marking the spec stable, add at least 1-2 other build types to
validate that the design is general enough to apply to other builders.

## Migrating from 0.2

To migrate from [version 0.2](../v0.2) (`old`), use the following pseudocode.
The meaning of each field is unchanged unless otherwise noted.

```javascript
{
    "buildDefinition": {
        // The `buildType` MUST be updated for v1.0 to describe how to
        // interpret `inputArtifacts`.
        "buildType": /* updated version of */ old.buildType,
        "externalParameters": old.invocation.parameters + {
            // It is RECOMMENDED to rename "entryPoint" to something more
            // descriptive.
            "entryPoint": old.invocation.configSource.entryPoint,
            // OPTION 1:
            // If the old `configSource` was the sole top-level input,
            // (i.e. containing the source or a pointer to the source):
            "source": {
                "artifactRef": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                },
            },
            // OPTION 2:
            // If the old `configSource` contained just build configuration
            // and a separate top-level input contained the source:
            "source": {
                "artifactRef": old.materials[indexOfSource],
            },
            "config": {
                "artifactRef": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                },
            },
        },
        "systemParameters": {
            "artifacts": null, // not in v0.2
            "values": old.invocation.environment,
        },
        "resolvedDependencies": old.materials,
    },
    "runDetails": {
        "builder": {
            "id": old.builder.id,
            "version": null,  // not in v0.2
            "builderDependencies": null,  // not in v0.2
        },
        "metadata": {
            "invocationId": old.metadata.buildInvocationId,
            "startedOn": old.metadata.buildStartedOn,
            "finishedOn": old.metadata.buildFinishedOn,
        },
        "byproducts": null,  // not in v0.2
    },
}
```

The following fields from v0.2 are no longer present in v1.0:

-   `entryPoint`: Use `externalParameters[<name>]` instead.
-   `buildConfig`: No longer inlined into the provenance. Instead, either:
    -   If the configuration is a top-level input, record its digest in
        `externalParameters["config"]`.
    -   Else if there is a known use case for knowing the exact resolved
        build configuration, record its digest in `byproducts`. An example use
        case might be someone who wishes to parse the configuration to look for
        bad patterns, such as `curl | bash`.
    -   Else omit it.
-   `metadata.completeness`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.
-   `metadata.reproducible`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.

## Change history

### v1.0 (DRAFT)

Major refactor to reduce misinterpretation, including a minor change in model.

-   Significantly expanded all documentation.
-   Altered the model slightly to better align with real-world build systems,
    align with reproducible builds, and make verification easier.
-   Grouped fields into `buildDefinition` vs `runDetails`.
-   Renamed `parameters` and `environment` to `externalParameters` and
    `systemParameters`, respectively. Both can now reference artifacts or string
    values.
-   Split and merged `configSource` into `externalParameters`.
-   Split and merged `materials` into `resolvedDependencies`,
    `externalParameters`, `systemParameters`, and `builderDependencies`.
-   Added `localName`, `downloadLocation`, and `mediaType` to artifact
    references.
-   Removed `buildConfig`; can be replaced with
    `externalParameters.artifacts["config"]`, `byproducts`, or simply omitted.
-   Removed `completeness` and `reproducible`; now implied by `builder.id`.
-   Added `builder.version`.
-   Added `byproducts`.

### v0.2

Refactored to aid clarity and added `buildConfig`. The model is unchanged.

-   Replaced `definedInMaterial` and `entryPoint` with `configSource`.
-   Renamed `recipe` to `invocation`.
-   Moved `invocation.type` to top-level `buildType`.
-   Renamed `arguments` to `parameters`.
-   Added `buildConfig`, which can be used as an alternative to `configSource`
    to validate the configuration.

### rename: slsa.dev/provenance

Renamed to "slsa.dev/provenance".

### v0.1.1

-   Added `metadata.buildInvocationId`.

### v0.1

Initial version, named "in-toto.io/Provenance"
