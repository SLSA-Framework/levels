title: Provenance
layout: standard
hero_text: To trace software back to the source and define the moving parts in a complex supply chain, provenance needs to be there from the very beginning. Itâ€™s the verifiable information about software artifacts describing where, when and how something was produced. For higher SLSA levels and more resilient integrity guarantees, provenance requirements are stricter and need a deeper, more technical understanding of the predicate.
---

## Purpose

Describe how an artifact or set of artifacts was produced so that:

-   Consumers of the provenance can verify that the artifact was built according
    to expectations.
-   Others can rebuild the artifact, if desired.

This predicate is the recommended way to satisfy the SLSA [provenance
requirements].

## Prerequisite

Understanding of SLSA [Software Attestations](/attestation-model)
and the larger [in-toto attestation] framework.

## Model

Provenance is an attestation that the `builder` produced the `subject` software
artifacts through execution of the `buildDefinition`.

The builder is trusted to have faithfully recorded the provenance; there is no
option but to trust the builder. However, the builder may have performed this
operation at the request of some external, possibly untrusted entity.

See [Examples](#examples) for concrete examples.

> **TODO:** Align with the [Build model](../spec/v1.0/terminology.md).

> **TODO:** Link to principles page in "no option to trust the builder" once
> [#528](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/528) lands.

## Schema

> **TODO:** Get proper syntax highlighting for cue, and explain that this is a
> cue schema.

```jsonc
{% include_relative v1.0.cue %}
```

### Parsing rules

This predicate follows the in-toto attestation [parsing rules]. Summary:

-   Consumers MUST ignore unrecognized fields.
-   The `predicateType` URI includes the major version number and will always
    change whenever there is a backwards incompatible change.
-   Minor version changes are always backwards compatible and "monotonic." Such
    changes do not update the `predicateType`.
-   Producers MAY add extension fields using field names that are URIs.
-   Optional fields MAY be unset or null, and should be treated equivalently.
    Both are equivalent to empty for _object_ or _array_ values.

### Fields

_NOTE: This section describes the fields within `predicate`. For a description
of the other top-level fields, such as `subject`, see [Statement]._

> **TODO:** Automatically parse the proto and render it directly here, rather
> than a simple inclusion of the raw schema file.

```proto
{% include_relative v1.0.proto %}
```

## Examples

> **TODO:** Use the same source repo in all examples for consistency.

> **TODO:** Automatically verify all examples against the cue schema.

### Container-based reproducible build

> **WARNING:** This is not yet finalized. So far this is an idea under
> discussion to have the provenance document the input for reproducible builds,
> where the input is a container image + entry point. We will point to the
> actual documentation once the design is ready.

> **TODO:** Move this to a separate file with a full description.

## Migrating from 0.2

To migrate from [version 0.2][0.2] (`old`), use the following pseudocode. The
meaning of each field is unchanged unless otherwise noted.

```javascript
{
    "buildDefinition": {
        "topLevelInputs": {
            // The `buildType` MUST be updated for v1.0 to describe how to
            // interpret `inputArtifacts`.
            "buildType": (updated version of) old.buildType,
            "inputArtifacts": {
                // OPTION 1:
                // If the old `configSource` was the sole top-level input,
                // (i.e. containing the source or a pointer to the source):
                "source": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                },
                // OPTION 2:
                // If the old `configSource` contained just build configuration
                // and a separate top-level input contained the source:
                "source": old.materials[indexOfSource],
                "config": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                }
            },
            "entryPoint": old.invocation.configSource.entryPoint,
            "parameters": old.invocation.parameters,
        },
        "buildDependencies": {
            "resolvedDependencies": old.materials,
            "environment": old.invocation.environment,
        }
    },
    "runDetails": {
        "builder": {
            "id": old.builder.id,
            "version": null  // not in v0.2
            "builderDependencies": null // not in v0.2
        },
        "metadata": {
            "invocationId": old.metadata.buildInvocationId,
            "startedOn": old.metadata.buildStartedOn,
            "finishedOn": old.metadata.buildFinishedOn,
        },
        "byproducts": null  // not in v0.2
    }
}
```

The following fields from v0.2 are no longer present in v1.0:

-   `buildConfig`: Instead of inlining the resolved build configuration into the
    provenance, either:
    -   If the configuration is a top-level input, record its digest in
        `inputArtifacts["config"]`.
    -   Else if there is a known use case for knowing the exact resolved
        build configuration, record its digest in `byproducts`. An example use
        case might be someone who wishes to parse the configuration to look for
        bad patterns, such as `curl | bash`.
    -   Else omit it.
-   `metadata.completeness`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.
-   `metadata.reproducible`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.

## Change history

### v1.0 (DRAFT)

Refactored to reduce the chance of mistakes in interpretation. The model has
changed slightly.

-   Grouped fields into `buildDefinition.topLevelInputs`,
    `buildDefinition.buildDependencies`, and `runDetails` according to their use
    case and security properties.
-   Replaced `buildConfig` with `inputArtifacts` to allow for multiple top-level
    input artifacts to be specified.
-   Moved `entryPoint` out of `buildConfig` so that all artifact references
    share a common schema.
-   Added `builder.version` and `builder.builderDependencies`.
-   Added `byproducts`.
-   Removed `buildConfig`; can use `inputArtifacts.config` or `byproducts`
    instead.
-   Removed `completeness` and `reproducible`; now implied by `builder.id`.

### v0.2

Refactored to aid clarity and added `buildConfig`. The model is unchanged.

-   Replaced `definedInMaterial` and `entryPoint` with `configSource`.
-   Renamed `recipe` to `invocation`.
-   Moved `invocation.type` to top-level `buildType`.
-   Renamed `arguments` to `parameters`.
-   Added `buildConfig`, which can be used as an alternative to `configSource`
    to validate the configuration.

### slsa.dev/provenance

Renamed to "slsa.dev/provenance".

### 0.1.1

-   Added `metadata.buildInvocationId`.

### 0.1

Initial version, named "in-toto.io/Provenance"
