title: Provenance
layout: standard
hero_text: To trace software back to the source and define the moving parts in a complex supply chain, provenance needs to be there from the very beginning. Itâ€™s the verifiable information about software artifacts describing where, when and how something was produced. For higher SLSA levels and more resilient integrity guarantees, provenance requirements are stricter and need a deeper, more technical understanding of the predicate.
---

## Purpose

Describe how an artifact or set of artifacts was produced so that:

1.  Consumers of the provenance can verify that the artifact was built according
    to expectations.
2.  Others can rebuild the artifact, if desired.

This predicate is the recommended way to satisfy the SLSA [provenance
requirements].

## Prerequisite

Understanding of SLSA [Software Attestations](/attestation-model)
and the larger [in-toto attestation] framework.

## Model

> **TODO:** Rewrite this intro.

Provenance is an attestation that some entity, the **builder**, produced one or
more software artifacts (the `subject` of an in-toto attestation [Statement]) by
executing some `buildDefinition`.

The builder is trusted to have faithfully recorded the provenance; there is no
option but to trust the builder. However, the builder may have performed this
operation at the request of some external, possibly untrusted entity. These
untrusted parameters are captured in the invocation's `parameters` and some of
the `materials`. Finally, the build may have depended on various environmental
parameters (`environment`) that are needed for [reproducing][reproducible] the
build but that are not under external control.

See [Examples](#examples) for concrete examples.

> **TODO:** Create a new diagram.

## Schema

> **TODO:** Get proper syntax highlighting for cue, and explain that this is a
> cue schema.

```jsonc
{% include_relative v1.0.cue %}
```

### Parsing rules

This predicate follows the in-toto attestation [parsing rules]. Summary:

-   Consumers MUST ignore unrecognized fields.
-   The `predicateType` URI includes the major version number and will always
    change whenever there is a backwards incompatible change.
-   Minor version changes are always backwards compatible and "monotonic." Such
    changes do not update the `predicateType`.
-   Producers MAY add extension fields using field names that are URIs.
-   Optional fields MAY be unset or null, and should be treated equivalently.
    Both are equivalent to empty for _object_ or _array_ values.

### Fields

_NOTE: This section describes the fields within `predicate`. For a description
of the other top-level fields, such as `subject`, see [Statement]._

> **TODO:** Automatically parse the proto and render it directly here, rather
> than a simple inclusion of the raw schema file.

```proto
{% include_relative v1.0.proto %}
```

## Examples

> **TODO:** Use the same source repo in all examples for consistency.

> **TODO:** Automatically verify all examples against the cue schema.

### Container-based build

> **WARNING:** This is not yet finalized.

> **TODO:** Move this to a separate file with a full description.

## Migrating from 0.2

To migrate from [version 0.2][0.2] (`old`), use the following pseudocode. The
meaning of each field is unchanged unless otherwise noted.

```javascript
{
    "buildDefinition": {
        "topLevelInputs": {
            // The `buildType` MUST be updated for v1.0 to describe how to
            // interpret `inputArtifacts`.
            "buildType": old.buildType,
            "inputArtifacts": {
                // OPTION 1:
                // If the old `configSource` was the sole top-level input,
                // (i.e. containing the source or a pointer to the source):
                "source": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                },
                // OPTION 2:
                // If the old `configSource` contained just build configuration
                // and a separate top-level input contained the source:
                "source": old.materials[indexOfSource],
                "config": {
                    "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                    "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
                }
            },
            "entryPoint": old.invocation.configSource.entryPoint,
            "parameters": old.invocation.parameters,
        },
        "buildDependencies": {
            "resolvedDependencies": old.materials,
            "environment": old.invocation.environment,
        }
    },
    "runDetails": {
        "builder": {
            "id": old.builder.id,
            "version": null  // not in v0.2
        },
        "metadata": {
            "invocationId": old.metadata.buildInvocationId,
            "startedOn": old.metadata.buildStartedOn,
            "finishedOn": old.metadata.buildFinishedOn,
        },
        "byproducts": null  // not in v0.2
    }
}
```

The following fields from v0.2 are no longer present in v1.0:

*   `buildConfig`: Replacement depends on the use case:
    *   If the build configuration is an independent input, hash it
        deterministically and include it as `inputArtifacts.config`.
    *   Else if there is a known use case for the resolved build configuration,
        hash it deterministically and include it in `byproducts`.
    *   Else omit it.
*   `metadata.completeness`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.
*   `metadata.reproducible`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.

## Change history

> **TODO:** Use headings for versions rather than bullets.

-   1.0: Refactored to steer guide implementers to do the right thing.
    -   **TODO**: describe changes
-   0.2: Refactored to aid clarity and added `buildConfig`. The model is
    unchanged.
    -   Replaced `definedInMaterial` and `entryPoint` with `configSource`.
    -   Renamed `recipe` to `invocation`.
    -   Moved `invocation.type` to top-level `buildType`.
    -   Renamed `arguments` to `parameters`.
    -   Added `buildConfig`, which can be used as an alternative to
        `configSource` to validate the configuration.
-   Renamed to "slsa.dev/provenance".
-   0.1.1: Added `metadata.buildInvocationId`.
-   0.1: Initial version, named "in-toto.io/Provenance"
