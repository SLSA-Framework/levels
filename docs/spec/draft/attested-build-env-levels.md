title: Build Environment track
description: This page gives an overview of the SLSA Build Environment track and its levels, describing their security objectives and general requirements.
---

## Rationale

Today's hosted build platforms play a central role in an artifact's supply
chain. Whether it's a cloud-hosted service like GitHub Actions or an internal
enterprise CI/CD system, the build platform has a privileged level of access
to artifacts and sensitive operations during a build (e.g., access to
producer secrets, provenance signing).

This central and privileged role makes hosted build platforms an attractive
target for supply chain attackers. But even with strong economic and
reputational incentives to mitigate these risks, it's very challenging to
implement fully secure build platforms because they are made up of many
layers of interconnected components and subsystems.

The SLSA Build Environment track aims to address these issues by making it
possible to validate the integrity and trace the provenance of core build
platform components.

## Track overview

The SLSA Build Environment track describes increasing levels of integrity and
trustworthiness of the <dfn>provenance</dfn> of a build's execution context.
In this track, provenance describes how a [build image] was created, how the
[hosted] build platform deployed a build image in its environment,
and the compute platform they used.

| Track/Level   | Requirements | Focus
| ------------- | ------------ | -----
| [Environment L0] | (none)       | (n/a)
| [Environment L1] | Build image provenance exists | Tampering during build image distribution
| [Environment L2] | Attested build environment deployment | Tampering via the build platform's control plane
| [Environment L3] | Hardware-authenticated build environment | Tampering via the compute platform's host interface
| [Environment L4] | Encrypted build environment | Tampering and data leaks by the build platform or compute platform during the build

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Environment track currently requires a [hosted] build platform.
> A future version of this track may generalize requirements to cover local
> build environments (e.g., developer laptop).

### Build environment model

<p align="center"><img src="images/build-env-model.svg" alt="Model Build Environment"></p>

The Build Environment track expands upon the [build model] by explicitily
separating the *build image* and *compute platform* from the abstract build
environment and build platform.

A typical build environment will go through the following lifecycle:

1.  *Build image creation*: A build image producer creates different build
    images through dedicated build process. For the SLSA Environment track,
    the build image producer outputs provenance describing this process.
2.  *Build environment deployment*: The hosted build platform calls into the
    *host interface* to deploy a new build environment from a given build
    image on the underlying compute platform.
    For the SLSA Environment track, the hosted build platform attests to the
    *measurement* of the environment's *initial state* during its boot
    process.
3.  *Build dispatch*: When the tenant dispatches a new build, the hosted
    build platform assigns the build to a deployed build environment. For
    the SLSA Environment track, the build platform attests to the binding
    between a build environment and *build ID*.
4.  *Build execution*: Finally, the *build executor* running within the
environment executes the tenant's build definition.

### Definitions

The Build Environment track specifies the following supply chain components
and roles:

| Primary Term | Description
| --- | ---
| Build ID | An immutable identifier assigned uniquely to a specific execution of a tenant's build. In practice, the build ID may be a cryptographic key or other unique and immutable identfier (e.g., a UUID) associated with the build execution.
| Build image | The template for a build environment, such as a VM or container image. Individual components of a build image include the bootable storage volume containing the build executor, a dedicated build platform client, and pre-installed guest OS and packages.
| Build image producer | The party that creates and distributes build images. In practice, the build image producer may be the hosted build platform or a third party in a BYO build image setting.
| Build executor | A platform-provided program dedicated to executing the tenantâ€™s build definition, i.e., running the build, within the build environment. The build executor must be included in the build image's measurement.
| Build platform client | A platform-provided program that interfaces with the hosted build platform's control plane from within a running build environment. The build platform client must be included in the build image's measurement.
| Build dispatch | The process of assigning a tenant's build to a pre-deployed build environment on a hosted build platform.
| Compute platform | The compute system and infrastructure underlying a build platform, i.e., the host system (hypervisor and/or OS) and hardware. In practice, the compute platform and the build platform may be managed by the same or distinct organizations.
| Host interface | The component in the compute platform that the hosted build platform uses to request resources for deploying new build environments, i.e., the VMM/hypervisor or container orchestrator.
| Boot process | In the context of builds, the process of loading and executing the layers of firmware and/or software needed to start up a build environment on the build platform.
| Measurement | The cryptographic hash of some system state in the build environment, including software binaries, configuration, or initialized run-time data. Software layers that are commonly measured include the bootloader, kernel, and kernel cmdline.

### Build environment threats

TODO

## Environment levels

The primary purpose of the Environment track is to enable [auditing] that a
build was run in the expected compute environment.

The lowest level only requires SLSA Build L1 (or higher) Provenance to exist
for the build image, while higher levels provide increasing auditability of
the build environment's properties and integrity of the generated provenance
attestations. The highest levels introduce further requirements for hardware-
assisted hardening aimed at reducing the trusted computing base of a build.

Software producers and third-party auditors can check attestations generated
by the build image producer and build platform against the expected
properties for a given build environment. This enables any party to detect
[several classes] of supply chain threats originating the build environment.

As in the Build track, the exact implementation of this track is determined
by the build platform provider, whether they are a commercial CI/CD service,
or enterprise organization. While this track describes
general [TODO: minimum requirements], this track does not dictate the
following implementation-specific details: the type of build environment
environment, accepted attestation formats, the type of technologies used to
meet L3/4 requirements, what SLSA [Build] level the *built artifacts* meet,
how attestations are distributed, how build environments are identified, and
what happens on failure.

### Environment L1: Signed build image provenance exists

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

The build image (i.e., VM or container image) used to instantiate the build
environment has SLSA provenance showing how the image was built.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Build platforms and organizations wanting to ensure a baseline level of
integrity for build environments at the time of build image generation.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

-   Build Image Producer:
    -   MUST automatially generate SLSA [Build L1] or higher
    Provenance for created build images (i.e., VM or container images).
    -   MUST allow independent automatic verification of a build image's SLSA
    Provenance. If the full Provenance document cannot be distributed, for
    example due to intellectual property concerns, a [VSA] asserting the
    build image's SLSA Provenance MUST be distributed instead.

-   Build Platform:
    -   MUST meet SLSA [Build L2] requirements.
    -   Prior to deployment of a new build environment, the SLSA Provenance
    for the selected build image MUST be automatically verified.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

-   Provides evidence that a build image was built from the advertised
    source and build process.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Environment L1], plus:

-   Build Image Producer:
    -   Build images MUST be created via a SLSA [Build L2] or higher build
    process.
    -   MUST add support in the build image for:
        -   Automatically checking the initial state of build image
        components against known good measurements during the boot process.
        In VM-based images, this can be achieved by enabling [trusted boot].
        In container-based build images, a dedicated program MUST be used to
        perform these checks.[^1]
        -   Automatically generating and distributing signed attestations
        that a given build environment instance was booted from a build image
        with verified measurements and SLSA Provenance (e.g., using [SCAI]
        or a [VSA]).
    -   MUST automatically generate and distribute signed measurements
    of the following build image components: bootloader (or equivalent),
    guest kernel, build platform client, build executor, and root filesystem.
    Additional build image components whose initial state is to be checked
    MAY be also measured.

-   Build Platform Requirements:
    -   MUST meet SLSA [Build L3] requirements.
    -   Prior to deployment of a new build environment, a signed attestation
    to the verification of the build image's SLSA Provenance MUST be
    automatically generated and distributed (e.g., via a [VSA]).
    -   Prior to dispatching a tenant's build to a deployed build
    environment, its initial state attestations MUST be automatically
    verified.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

-   Provides evidence that a build environment deployed by a hosted build
    platform was instantiated from a known good build image and is at the
    expected initial state.
