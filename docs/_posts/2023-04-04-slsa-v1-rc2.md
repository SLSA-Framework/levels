Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of SLSA v1.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) following the valuable feedback we received on the first release candidate. With RC2, we are still looking for additional feedback from the community. This time however, we are only looking for editorial clarifications. We are looking for feedback that will not impact compliance or the provenance specification.

The deadline for feedback on editorial clarifications is April 18th, 2024. We plan to release the 1.0 Stable revision soon after addressing any remaining concerns.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/issues) to provide feedback by April 18th, 2024. We are specifically looking for comments on the following:

- Are there any unclear or ambiguous sections in the SLSA v1.0 RC2 Specification that would benefit from editorial clarification
- Are there any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the terminology used throughout the specification?

We appreciate the continued support and engagement from the SLSA community and all early adopters who have provided valuable feedback on the previous release candidate. Thank you for your contributions to the project!
