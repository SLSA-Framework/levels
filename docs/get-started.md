## Choosing your SLSA level

For all [SLSA levels](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels), you follow the same steps:

1)  Generate provenance, i.e., document your build process
2)  Make the provenance available, to allow downstream users to verify it

What differs for each level is the robustness of the build and provenance. For more information about provenance see [https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2).

The builders suggested in this guide meet SLSA expectations. If you believe a build option is missing or misclassified, please [open an issue](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/589).

SLSA levels are progressive: SLSA 3 includes all the guarantees of SLSA 2, and SLSA 2 includes all the guarantees of SLSA 1. Currently, though, the work required to achieve lower SLSA levels will not necessarily accrue toward the work needed to achieve higher SLSA levels because lower SLSA levels may not be compatible with future implementations. For that reason, **you should start with the highest level that’s possible for your project or organization to avoid wasted work**.

The SLSA level you implement depends on your current build situation:

-   If you are using GitHub Actions, jump directly to [SLSA 3](#SLSA3). You do not need to implement SLSA 1 or SLSA 2.
-   If you are using [FRSCA](https://github.com/buildsec/frsca), jump to [SLSA 2](#SLSA2). You do not need to implement SLSA 1.
-   If you’re using any other build system or are not using a build system, consider adopting GitHub Actions, or FRSCA. If that isn’t possible, start with [SLSA 1](#SLSA1). Note that if you choose to use SLSA 1, you may not have a growth path to [SLSA 2](#SLSA2) or [SLSA 3](#SLSA3). It is recommended that unless you have a specific reason for using SLSA 1, that you start with [SLSA 2](#SLSA2), or if possible [SLSA 3](#SLSA3).

### Provenance verification

Various build methods require different methods to verify provenance. The SLSA community already has some verification methods and is working on additional solutions for provenance verification. Even if there is currently no simple verification method for a particular build system, adopting these builders now means you will be “SLSA ready” when more ecosystem tooling is released. Note that when you create provenance, you must supply to users a method for interpreting what you have created.

### Provenance formatting

Your provenance format depends on who will be consuming it. See [provenance](/provenance) for an explanation of which format to choose.

### Provenance storage

Containers have a standard place to put the provenance in the OCI container registry. With time, the SLSA community hopes to create standard ecosystem-based repositories for provenance. For now, the convention is to keep the provenance attestation with your artifact. Though the sigstore bundle that's used currently is semi-standard, the format of the provenance is currently tool-specific.

## SLSA 1

As mentioned, if you don't already use a build service or CI/CD, we recommend you adopt one of the systems listed under SLSA 2 or SLSA 3. While this is not required for SLSA 1, it makes the following steps easier and is required for higher SLSA levels. Individual developers who wish to put a minimal amount of security on their builds can use SLSA 1.

SLSA 1 requires that the build process is documented. Some tools suggested below also support signed provenance. Though not required for SLSA 1, signing your provenance increases trust in the document by showing that it has not been tampered with.

### Tooling

A build configuration file (i.e., GitHub workflow) qualifies for SLSA 1. It would be considered unsigned, unformatted provenance.

### Build service plugins or extensions

These options work with your build system to produce unsigned, formatted provenance. They do not qualify for SLSA 2 because they are unsigned and not run by the hosted server:

-   [Azure DevOps extension](https://github.com/slsa-framework/azure-devops-demo)
-   [Jenkins SLSA generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-jenkins-generator)
-   [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/in-toto/)

Downstream users may verify the provenance with [Cue Policies](https://cuelang.org/docs/).

### Build observers with hosted services

These options are user-configured inside a hosted service. They observe the build process and produce signed, formatted provenance. These options do not qualify for SLSA 2 because they are configured by users, not the hosted service.

Downstream users may verify the provenance with Cue policies and the signature with Cosign.

**Note:** If you are using one of these options with GitHub Actions, jump to SLSA 3 and use the builder itself to generate provenance.

-   If you’re using [Tejolote](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/tejolote) with GitHub Actions, jump to SLSA 3 and generate provenance directly from the builder.
-   [Tekton Chains](https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/signed-provenance-tutorial/) – custom resource definition controller that can generate provenance for Kubernetes OCI containers

## SLSA 2

To achieve SLSA 2, the goals are to:

-   Run your build on a hosted service that generates and signs provenance
-   Publish the provenance to allow downstream users to verify it

There is currently only one SLSA 2 builder:

-   [Factory for Repeatable Secure Creation of Artifacts (FRSCA)](https://github.com/buildsec/frsca)

FRSCA is an OpenSSF project that aims at offering a full build pipeline. It is not yet generally available. It qualifies as a SLSA 2 builder because regular users of the service are not able to inject or alter the contents of the provenance it generates. FRSCA produces signed, formatted provenance that can be verified by the generic SLSA verifier.

## SLSA 3

To achieve SLSA 3, you must:

-   Run your build on a hosted service that generates and signs provenance
-   Ensure that build runs cannot influence each other
-   Produce signed provenance that can be verified as authentic

### GitHub Actions

If you are building on GitHub Actions, adopt the [Language-agnostic GitHub provenance generator / builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) to make your build qualify for SLSA 3. Consumers can use the [Generic SLSA Verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) for provenance verification.

## Builder SLSA levels

The following table shows known build software packages and the SLSA level they qualify for.

| Builder                 | SLSA Level |
|-------------------------|------------|
| FRSCA                   | 2          |
| GitHub Actions          | 3          |
| Google Cloud Build      | 3          |
| No Build Service        | 1          |
