### Adding a new maintainer

We manage Maintainer permissions with the GitHub team,
[Specification Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/slsa-framework/teams/specification-maintainers).
We keep that group and this documentation in sync manually.
Whenever adding a new maintainer in this file, please add the user to the group.
For instructions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team).

## Emeritus maintainers (in alphabetical order)

Emeritus maintainers have maintained the SLSA specification in the past but are
not currently doing so.

### Transitioning to emeritus

Maintainers may transition to emeritus status by request. They may also
transition to emeritus status automatically if they are not active in the SLSA
community for six (6) months. "Active" is loosely defined to mean performing the
Maintainer duties defined in the [SLSA Governance](https://github.com/slsa-framework/governance/blob/main/5._Governance.md) documentation.
Any ambiguity in whether or not a maintainer is considered active will be
resolved by the other maintainers. There should always be at least three active
maintainers, so automatic transitions to emeritus status will pause if there
are three or fewer active maintainers.

Whenever transitioning a maintainer to emeritus status, please remove the user
from that group and move their row from the Current maintainers table to the
Emeritus maintainers table. For instructions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team).
