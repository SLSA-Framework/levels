### Adding a new maintainer

We manage Maintainer permissions with the GitHub team,
[Specification Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/slsa-framework/teams/specification-maintainers).
We keep that group and this documentation in sync manually.
Whenever adding a new maintainer in this file, please add the user to the group.
For instructions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team).
