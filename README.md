# SLSA: Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts

<!--{% if false %}-->

<!--{% endif %}-->

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA, pronounced _[salsa]_) is an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain. The requirements are inspired by Google’s internal "[Binary Authorization for Borg]" that has been in use for the past 8+ years and that is mandatory for all of Google's production workloads.

* one
* two

The goal of SLSA is to improve the state of the industry, particularly open
source, to defend against the most pressing integrity threats. With SLSA,
consumers can make informed choices about the security posture of the software
they consume.

**IMPORTANT:** SLSA is an evolving specification and we are looking for
wide-ranging feedback via [GitHub issues], [email][mailing list], or
[feedback form]. SLSA is being developed as part of the
[OpenSSF Digital Identity WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-digital-identity-attestation).

## Why SLSA?

Supply chain integrity attacks—unauthorized modifications to software
packages—have been
[on the rise](https://www.sonatype.com/hubfs/Corporate/Software%20Supply%20Chain/2020/SON_SSSC-Report-2020_final_aug11.pdf#page=7)
in the past two years, and are proving to be common and reliable attack vectors
that affect all consumers of software. The software development and deployment
supply chain is quite complicated, with numerous threats along the source ➞
build ➞ publish workflow. While point solutions do exist for some specific
vulnerabilities, there is no comprehensive end-to-end framework that both
defines how to mitigate threats across the software supply chain, and provides
reasonable security guarantees. There is an urgent need for a solution in the
face of the eye-opening, multi-billion dollar attacks in recent months (e.g.
[SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory),
[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/security-update/)), some of which could have
been prevented or made more difficult had such a framework been adopted by
software developers and consumers.

SLSA addresses three issues:

-   Software producers want to secure their supply chains but don't know
   exactly how;
-   Software consumers want to understand and limit their exposure to supply
   chain attacks but have no means of doing so;
-   Artifact signatures alone prevent only a subset of the attacks we care about.

### Supply Chain Threats

SLSA helps to protect against common supply chain attacks. The following image
illustrates a typical software supply chain and includes examples of attacks
that can occur at every link in the chain. Each type of attack has occured over
the past several years and, unfortunately, is increasing as time goes on.

Many recent high-profile attacks were consequences of supply-chain integrity
vulnerabilities, and could have been prevented by SLSA's framework. For
example:

A SLSA level gives consumers confidence that software has not been tampered with
and can be securely traced back to source—something that is difficult, if not
impossible, to do with most software today.

## What is SLSA?

SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable security guidelines, established by
industry consensus. The standards set by SLSA are guiding principles for both
software producers and consumers: producers can follow the guidelines to make
their software more secure, and consumers can make decisions based on a software
package's security posture. SLSA's [four levels](#slsa-levels) are designed to be
incremental and actionable, and to protect against specific integrity attacks. SLSA 4 represents the ideal end
state, and the lower levels represent milestones with corresponding integrity
guarantees.

### Terminology

SLSA's framework addresses every step of the software supply chain—the sequence
of steps resulting in the creation of an artifact. We represent a supply chain
as a [directed acyclic
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of sources, builds,
dependencies, and packages. One artifact's supply chain is a combination of its
dependencies' supply chains plus its own sources and builds.

![Software Supply Chain Model](images/supply-chain-model.svg)

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Term
   <th>Description
   <th>Example
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>Artifact
   <td>An immutable blob of data; primarily refers to software, but SLSA can be used for any artifact
   <td>A file, a git commit, a directory of files (serialized in some way), a container image, a firmware image.
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Source
   <td>Artifact that was directly authored or reviewed by persons, without modification. It is the beginning of the supply chain; we do not trace the provenance back any further.
   <td>Git commit (source) hosted on GitHub (platform).
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Build
   <td>Process that transforms a set of input artifacts into a set of output artifacts. The inputs may be sources, dependencies, or ephemeral build outputs.
   <td>.travis.yml (process) run by Travis CI (platform).
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Package
   <td>Artifact that is "published" for use by others. In the model, it is
   always the output of a build process, though that build process can be a
   no-op.
   <td>Docker image (package) distributed on DockerHub (platform).
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Dependency
   <td>Artifact that is an input to a build process but that is not a source. In
   the model, it is always a package.
   <td>Alpine package (package) distributed on Alpine Linux (platform).
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

Special cases:

-   A ZIP file is containing source code is a package, not a source, because it
    is built from some other source, such as a git commit.

### SLSA Levels

There are four SLSA levels. SLSA 4 is the current highest level and represents
the ideal end state. SLSA 1–3 offer lower security guarantees but are easier to
meet. In our experience, achieving SLSA 4 can take many years and significant
effort, so intermediate milestones are important. We also use the term SLSA 0 to
mean the lack of a SLSA level.

**SLSA 1** requires that the build process be fully scripted/automated and
generate provenance. Provenance is metadata about how an artifact was built,
including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies. Knowing the
provenance allows software consumers to make risk-based security decisions.
Though provenance at SLSA 1 does not protect against tampering, it offers a
basic level of code source identification and may aid in vulnerability
management.

**SLSA 2** requires using version control and a hosted build service that
generates authenticated provenance. These additional requirements give the
consumer greater confidence in the origin of the software. At this level, the
provenance prevents tampering to the extent that the build service is trusted.
SLSA 2 also provides an easy upgrade path to SLSA 3.

**SLSA 3** further requires that the source and build platforms meet specific
standards to guarantee the auditability of the source and the integrity of the
provenance, respectively. We envision an accreditation process whereby auditors
certify that platforms meet the requirements, which consumers can then rely on.
SLSA 3 provides much stronger protections against tampering than earlier levels
by preventing specific classes of threats, such as cross-build contamination.

**SLSA 4** is currently the highest level, requiring two-person review of all
changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process. Two-person review is an
industry best practice for catching mistakes and deterring bad behavior.
Hermetic builds guarantee that the provenance's list of dependencies is
complete. Reproducible builds, though not strictly required, provide many
auditability and reliability benefits. Overall, SLSA 4 gives the consumer a high
degree of confidence that the software has not been tampered with.

The SLSA level is not transitive [(see explanation)](#q-why-is-slsa-not-transitive). It describes the integrity
protections of an artifact's build process and top-level source, but nothing
about the artifact's dependencies. Dependencies have their own SLSA ratings, and
it is possible for a SLSA 4 artifact to be built from SLSA 0 dependencies.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Why is SLSA not transitive?

SLSA is not transitive in order to make the problem tractable. If SLSA 4
required dependencies to be SLSA 4, then reaching SLSA 4 would require starting
at the very beginning of the supply chain and working forward. This is
backwards, forcing us to work on the least risky component first and blocking
any progress further downstream. By making each artifact's SLSA rating
independent from one another, it allows parallel progress and prioritization
based on risk. (This is a lesson we learned when deploying other security
controls at scale throughout Google.) We expect SLSA ratings to be composed to describe a supply chain's overall
security stance, as described in the case study [vision](walkthrough.md#vision-case-study).

#### Q: What about reproducible builds?

When talking about [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org),
there are two related but distinct concepts: "reproducible" and
"verified reproducible."

"Reproducible" means that repeating the build with the same inputs results in
bit-for-bit identical output. This property
[provides](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/)
[many](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About)
[benefits](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/sre.google/en//static/pdf/building_secure_and_reliable_systems.pdf#page=357),
including easier debugging, more confident cherry-pick releases, better build
caching and storage efficiency, and accurate dependency tracking.

For these reasons, SLSA 4 [requires](#level-requirements) reproducible builds
unless there is a justification why the build cannot be made reproducible.
[Example](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2021-January/002177.html)
justifications include profile-guided optimizations or code signing that
invalidates hashes. Note that there is no actual reproduction, just a claim that
reproduction is possible.

"Verified reproducible" means using two or more independent build systems to
corroborate the provenance of a build. In this way, one can create an overall
system that is more trustworthy than any of the individual components. This is
often
[suggested](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/blog/preventing-supply-chain-attacks-like-solarwinds/)
as a solution to supply chain integrity. Indeed, this is one option to secure
build steps of a supply chain. When designed correctly, such a system can
satisfy all of the SLSA build requirements.

That said, verified reproducible builds are not a complete solution to supply
chain integrity, nor are they practical in all cases:

-   Reproducible builds do not address source, dependency, or distribution
    threats.
-   Reproducers must truly be independent, lest they all be susceptible to the
    same attack. For example, if all rebuilders run the same pipeline software,
    and that software has a vulnerability that can be triggered by sending a
    build request, then an attacker can compromise all rebuilders, violating the
    assumption above.
-   Some builds cannot easily be made reproducible, as noted above.
-   Closed-source reproducible builds require the code owner to either grant
    source access to multiple independent rebuilders, which is unacceptable in
    many cases, or develop multiple, independent in-house rebuilders, which is
    likely prohibitively expensive.

Therefore, SLSA does not require verified reproducible builds directly. Instead,
verified reproducible builds are one option for implementing the requirements.

    builders to express properties in a standard way that can be consumed by
    anyone. Also includes reference implementations for generating these
    attestations.
